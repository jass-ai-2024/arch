Technical specifications for the development of an automatic content generation system for Instagram

Project objective:
To develop a system that allows the user to automatically generate content for Instagram reels based on the analysis of an existing account, target audience, and trends.

Functional requirements:

1. Uploading an Instagram account:
- The user can connect their Instagram account or the account of a company/person they want to create similar content to.
- The system must ensure a secure connection of the account for data analysis, while maintaining the user's privacy and confidentiality.

2. Account and target audience analysis:
- The model analyzes the account content (posts, reels, metrics for views, likes, comments).
- Based on the collected data, the model identifies the characteristics of the target audience (age, gender, interests, activity).
- The system offers the user three target audience options to choose from, with a brief description of each audience.
- The user selects one target audience option that best suits their goals.

3. Creating a content generation request:
- The user enters a request to create a video, describing the topic and main content (e.g. "massage video").
- The system accepts the request and interprets it for further content generation.

4. Searching for videos on stocks:
- The model searches for videos on popular stock platforms, taking into account the user's request and the preferences of the target audience.
- The selection of video materials must comply with the license requirements and be relevant to the request.

5. Generating a reel based on stocks:
- Based on the collected videos, the model generates a reel, automatically selecting timing, visual effects and editing transitions, focusing on current reel trends on Instagram.
- The reel timing must correspond to popular formats, which increases the likelihood of target audience engagement.
- The model automatically creates a reel structure, including musical accompaniment, effects and texts, based on an analysis of popular trends.

Non-functional requirements:

1. Usability:
- The system interface should be intuitive and convenient for users without technical skills.
- All generation stages should be visualized and accompanied by step-by-step instructions.

2. Performance:
- The time for analyzing an account and generating a reel should not exceed 10 minutes.
- Reels should be generated in a mode as close to real time as possible.

3. Privacy and security:
- User data should be protected at all stages, from connecting an account to storing and processing information.
- Integration with Instagram should comply with the API rules and privacy policies of the platform.

Technological requirements:

1. API integration:
- Integration with Instagram API to collect data on posts, reels, and account metrics.
- Use of stock platforms with open APIs to search for video content.

2. Machine learning and data analysis:
- Use of NLP methods and image analysis to determine the characteristics of content and target audience.
- The trend analysis model should be updated regularly to account for changes in reels trends.

Implementation stages:

1. Stage 1: Developing a system for uploading accounts and secure integration with Instagram.
2. Stage 2: Creating a model for analyzing content and identifying a target audience.
3. Stage 3: Implementing functionality for creating requests and searching for video materials.
4. Stage 4: Developing a model for generating reels taking into account trends.
5. Stage 5: Testing the system and improving it based on testing results.

Expected results:
- MVP of the system that allows users to connect accounts and generate reels.
- Increasing user content engagement through the use of current trends and audience analysis.
