ML Task #1: Research optimal NLP models for real-time toxic content detection across diverse languages
==================================================
ML Domain: NLP

Description:
Investigate and evaluate state-of-the-art NLP architectures and techniques to effectively detect and mitigate toxic content in real-time across a range of languages and dialects, ensuring high accuracy and minimal bias.

Technical Constraints:
- Achieve a toxic content identification accuracy rate of at least 95% consistently across different languages and dialects.
- Ensure real-time detection with a response latency of less than 2 seconds.

Evaluation Metrics:
- F1-score
- Precision
- Recall

Success Criteria:
- Achieve 95% detection accuracy
- Response latency under 2 seconds
