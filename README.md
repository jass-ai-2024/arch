### Overview
This project is an architectural agent service designed to facilitate creating architectural solutions. The service accepts user requests, interacts with other services (Deployment, Testing, Research), gathers responses, and returns a well-formed system document. The service is implemented using Python 3.7+ with the FastAPI library and is packaged in a Docker container. Additionally, the service can describe requirements in the form of C4 diagrams.

### Problem Statement (technology perspective)
In the realm of software development, creating comprehensive architectural solutions often involves multiple steps and interactions with various services. This project aims to streamline this process by providing a unified service that handles user requests, interacts with necessary services, and generates a detailed system document, including architectural diagrams.

### Objectives
- Objective 1: Develop a FastAPI-based service to handle user requests for creating architectural solutions.
- Objective 2: Implement interactions with Deployment, Testing, and Research services to gather necessary information or corrections.
- Objective 3: Generate and return a comprehensive system document, including C4 diagrams, UML diagrams, and deployment schemas.

### Features
- Feature 1: User Request Handling - Accepts user requests for creating architectural solutions.
- Feature 2: Service Interaction - Interacts with Deployment, Testing, and Research services to gather necessary information.
- Feature 3: System Document Generation - Generates and returns a detailed system document, including C4 diagrams, UML diagrams, and deployment schemas.
